IDL program that allows you to open a brightness temperature grid file and read
it into an array, making it available for further manipulation in IDL or to
write to hard disc. After the program has read the user-indicated time range, an
array is returned with a 2-byte integer array of brightness temperatures
expressed in tenths of a kelvin (0.1 K). For example, a value of 2358 translates
to 235.8 K.
